<section><title>Overview</title>
<para>On real display hardware a Graphics Address Remapping Table (GART) maps system memory into a graphics aperture,
which is also visible through a Base Address Register (BAR). One or more Cathode Ray Tube Controllers (CRTCs) scan the memory in the
graphics aperture and present the data to monitors. This device aims to
present a similar interface which should be easy to code against, and very easy
to implement in a virtualized enviroment.</para>
<para>A GART (preloaded with some quantity of e820 reserved memory) maps addresses in
the graphics aperture to system memory, and allows more system memory to be
mapped into the graphics aperture.</para>

<para>A set of VCRTCs can scan rasters in this graphics aperture and may or may not be
connected to a vMonitor. In the backend VCRTCs and vMonitors can be mapped and
unmapped onto the real hardwares CRTCS and Monitors via a variety of hardware
specific techniques.</para>

<para>XenGFX is surfaced as a PCI device which may be present at any Bus/Device/Function (BDF) in the system. It contains 3 BARs:</para>

<section><title>VCRTC Registers (Range 0x100000 - 0x1FFFFF)</title>
<para>
There are XGFX_NVCRTC banks of VCRTC registers. Each is able to scan a raster in
the graphics aperture and drive a virtual monitor. VCRTCs need not be connected
to a virtual monitor. At startup all VCRTCs will be disabled, so a driver is
free to ignore any of them. If the driver wishes to drive only one display it
should drive the first VCRTC only. In general surfman will identify active
VCRTCs when looking for vcrtcs to attach vmonitors to and map to real monitors.

0x1n0000 - XGFX_VCRTCn_STATUS:
  Read specific bits below which indicate the current status of the VCRTC.
  
  Bit 0: HOTPLUG   Set indicates the VCRTC is connected to a virtual monitor.
  Bit 1: ONSCREEN  Set indicates the VCRTC is connected to a real monitor 
	   			   (ie the virtual monitor, is currently displayed on a 
				   real monitor).
  Bit 2: RETRACE   Set indicates vertical retrace is in progress.
  Bits 3 - 31: Unused.
  
  Type: Read-Only
  
0x1n0004 - XGFX_VCRTCn_STATUS_CHANGE:
  Each bit in this register is a flip flop.  The flip fop is set when
  the corresponding bit in XGFX_VCRTCn_STATUS changes, and cleared when
  the CPU writes a 1 in the corresponding bit location to this register.
 
  Bit 0: D_HOTPLUG   Set indicates virtual monitor connected or removed.
  Bit 1: D_ONSCREEN	 Set indicates virtual monitor mapped or removed from 
				     real monitor.
  Bit 2: D_RETRACE   Set indicates vertical retrace occured. [NB: this 
				     bit may not be implemented].
  Bits 3 - 31: reserved will read zero
  
  Type: Read-Write-to-Clear
  
0x1n0008 - XGFX_VCRTCn_STATUS_INT:
  This register is ANDed with XGFX_VCRTCn_STATUS_CHANGE to generate the interrupt
  for this VCRTC, the VCRTC interrupt lines are ORed together and anded with
  with INT_EN to generate the adapter's interrupt line.
  
  Bit 0: HOTPLUG_INT_EN   Enable/disable virtual monitor connect/disconnect 
					      interrupts.
  Bit 1: ONSCREEN_INT_EN  Enable/disable mapping of real monitor interrupts.
  Bit 2: RETRACE_INT_EN	  Enable/disable vertical retrace interrupts.
					      [NB: this may not be implemented]
  Bits 3 - 31: Unused.
  
  Type: Read-Write
  
0x1n000C - XGFX_VCRTCn_SCANLINE:
  This register reports the current scanline counter value for the VCRTC
  [NB: This may not be implemented in which case it will report -1].

  Type: Read-Only
  
0x1n0010 - XGFX_VCRTCn_CURSOR_STATUS:
  Status register for reporting cursor status and capabilities.
  
  Bit 0: SUPPORTED  Set to 1 if HW cursor supported on this VCRTC.

  Type: Read-Only
  
0x1n0014 - XGFX_VCRTCn_CURSOR_CONTROL:
  Command register for controlling cursor.
  
  Bit 0: SHOW  Set to 1 to show cursor, set to 0 to hide cursor.
  Bits 1 - 31: Reserved, must be zero.
  
  Type: Read-Write
  
0x1n0018 - XGFX_VCRTCn_CURSOR_MAXSIZE:
  Indicates the maximum cursor size supported for this VCRTC. If this value
  is not suitable for a given platform, a software cursor will have to be 
  used. Note that 32bpp is implied.

  Bits 0 - 15:  Maximum height in scan lines.
  Bits 16 - 31: Maximum width in pixels.
  
  Type: Read-Only
  
0x1n001C - XGFX_VCRTCn_CURSOR_SIZE:

  Type: Read-Write
  
0x1n0020 - XGFX_VCRTCn_CURSOR_BASE:
  Offset into GART of cursor bitmap in ARGB format starting from the top
  left. The backend MAY choose to only read the cursor from the GART when
  this register is written to; alternatively it may read it every frame.
  Accordingly this register should be written to every time the cursor
  is modified.
        
  Type: Read-Write
  
0x1n0024 - XGFX_VCRTCn_CURSOR_POS:
  Sets the current cursor position co-oridates with the top left as the
  origin. Note the X and Y values are signed 2's complement values allowing
  negative co-oridates to indicate the cursor is partially off the screen to
  the left and/or top.
  
  Bits 0 - 15:  Y position in scan lines.
  Bits 16 - 31: X position in pixels.
  
  Type: Read-Write
  
0x1n1000 - XGFX_VCRTCn_EDID_LO:
  Low order 32 bits of the physical address of a DMA buffer to receive the 
  current EDID for the virtual monitor attached to this VCRTC. EDID_HI must be
  written first. Writing EDID_LO triggers the DMA write of the 256b EDID to the
  supplied buffer. The EDID will always be valid. If there is no monitor 
  attached, or if the attached monitor does not provide a valid EDID then
  a user selected platform EDID will be given.
  
  Type: Write-Only

0x1n1004 - XGFX_VCRTCn_EDID_HI:

  Bit 0: ENABLE  Set for enable this VCRTC.
  Bits 1 - 31: Unused.
  
  Type: Read-Write, Posted on XGFX_VCRTCn_BASE
  
0x1n2004 - XGFX_VCRTCn_VALID_FORMAT:
  This register lists the formats which this VCRTC supports. The register
  value will not change for the lifetime of a domain. (meaning that it 
  might change is the VM is migrated).  A one in this corresponding bit
  position indicates that the VCRTC will accept data in that format.  If
  no usable formats are found, the XGFX_FORMAT_RGBX8888 format can be used
  as a fall-back (the virtual hw will transform this format into another
  supported format).
  
  Bit 0: XGFX_FORMAT_RGB555
  Bit 1: XGFX_FORMAT_BGR555
  Bit 2: XGFX_FORMAT_RGB565

  Bit 6: XGFX_FORMAT_RGBX8888
  Bit 7: XGFX_FORMAT_BGRX8888
  Bits 8 - 31: Unused.
  
  Type: Read-Only
  
0x1n2008 - XGFX_VCRTCn_FORMAT:
  Driver should write exactly one bit (that is set in XGFX_VCRTCn_VALID_FORMAT)
  into this register to indicate the format that the framebuffer is in. 
  
  Type: Read-Write, Posted on XGFX_VCRTCn_BASE
  
0x1n2010 - XGFX_VCRTCn_MAX_HORIZONTAL:
  Maximum value of VCRTC_HORIZONTAL_ACTIVE (in width-in-pixels - 1). This value
  remains constant the lifetime of the domain.
  
  Type: Read-Only

0x1n2014 - XGFX_VCRTCn_HORIZONTAL_ACTIVE:
  Horizontal active period, the horizontal resolution of the framebuffer
  (in width-in-pixels - 1).
  
  Type: Read-Write, Posted on XGFX_VCRTCn_BASE
  
0x1n2018 - XGFX_VCRTCn_MAX_VERTICAL:
  Maximum value of the VCRTC_VERTICAL_ACTIVE (in height-in-scanlines - 1). This value
  remains constant the lifetime of the domain.
  
  Type: Read-Only

0x1n201C - XGFX_VCRTCn_VERTICAL_ACTIVE:
  Horizontal vertical period, the vertical resolution of the framebuffer
  (in height-in-scanlines - 1).
  
  Type: Read-Write, Posted on XGFX_VCRTCn_BASE
  
0x1n2020 - XGFX_VCRTCn_STRIDE_ALIGNMENT:
  Indicates the restrictions on values of the stride for this VCRTC. Value will
  remain constant for the lifetime of the domain. Each bit that reads 1 in this
  register must be written 0 in XGFX_VCRTCn_STRIDE and XGFX_VCRTCn_BASE. Ie if
  this register reads 0x1f then XGFX_VCRTCn_STRIDE and XGFX_VCRTCn_BASE must be
  a multiple of 0x20.
		
  Type: Read-Only
  
0x1n2024 - XGFX_VCRTCn_STRIDE:
  The stride of the framebuffer, in bytes. 
  
  Type: Read-Write, Posted on XGFX_VCRTCn_BASE

0x1n3000 - XGFX_VCRTCn_BASE:
  Address (offset in bytes) in the graphics aperture where the frame buffer
  starts. The same restrictions on alignment apply for this register. Writes
  to this register cause all Posted writes for this VCRTC to be flushed.
  
  Type: Read-Write
  </para>
</section>

<section><title>GART Registers (Range 0x200000 - 0x200000 + ( XGFX_GART_SIZE &lt;&lt; 12 )</title>
<para>Each GART register is 32b wide, and contains the PFN of 4Kb page of memory
to be mapped. GART[n] maps memory in the graphics aperture at offset (n&lt;&lt;12).

The following top bits of the GART register are reserved (non-address bits):
  Bit 31: When set indicated the GART register entry is valid, cleared for invalid.
  Bit 30: Reserved, must be zero.

On startup the first XGFX_STOLEN_SIZE registers of the GART will
be filled in as follows
