		<para>&COMPANY_NAME_SHORT; <indexterm><primary>&PB;</primary><secondary>about</secondary></indexterm>&PB; is a high-performance, bare-metal hypervisor that runs directly on the client device hardware, dividing up the resources of the machine and enabling multiple operating systems to run side by side in complete isolation.</para>
		
		<para>&PB; can run stand-alone, but working together with <indexterm><primary>Synchronizer</primary><secondary>overview</secondary></indexterm>&BACKEND;, the server-based application for IT administrators to manage &PB; virtual machine (VM) images, users, and their &PB; devices, &PB; provides a safe, secure and simple way to provision and administer virtual machine (VM) images, combining performance with ease of use.</para>
		
		<para>Together with &BACKEND;, &PB; provides the capacity to radically simplify the deployment and maintenance of VM images and applications to users in a way that provides secure computing and ease of use for users and administrators alike. By enabling multiple operating systems to be installed on a single computer and providing the ability to switch between running operating systems in real time, a user can, for example, have a single computer for both home and office use, with each operating system securely isolated from the other. Additionally, user data can be separated from system data, and the system data refreshed from a single location on a regular basis. This ensures the performance and great user experience of a fresh installation each day, and ease of patch deployment and operating system updates for IT administrators.</para> 
		
		<para>&BACKEND; is described in detail in the <citetitle>&PRODUCT_VERSION; &BACKEND; Setup and Usage Guide</citetitle>.</para> 
<!--
<para>&PB; integrates with &DAZZLE; to allow users to pull the applications they want onto their desktops and can also use &PORTICA; to seamlessly share application windows between operating systems.</para>
	-->
<para><indexterm><primary>&PB;</primary><secondary>overview</secondary></indexterm>The &PB; software is based on bare metal 64-bit <indexterm><primary>Xen</primary></indexterm>Xen virtualization technology. It can be thought of as a software layer that acts as an intermediary between virtual machines (VMs) running on the device and the physical hardware. This allows you to run multiple VMs on a single device simultaneously, and switch between them in real time. The hypervisor layer controls the resources of the physical machine (CPU, RAM, GPU, disk, and so on) and allocates them to VMs according to your settings.</para>

<para>&PB; management capabilities are provided by &BRAND_CONSOLE;. The &BRAND_CONSOLE; user interface is displayed after the &PB; software has been installed and the device has been rebooted to guide you through the process of installing VMs. VMs can be installed using CD or DVD disks, over the network, or by downloading a VM image from &BACKEND;. &BRAND_CONSOLE; also provides an easy-to-use network configuration utility, the ability to start, stop and hibernate VMs, and to interact with &BACKEND;.</para>
<para>Once you have installed the VMs you want to run on your device and started them, switching between running VMs is as easy as using a keystroke (for example, <keycap>Ctrl+<replaceable>2</replaceable></keycap>) or using the &PB; switcher bar, which appears when you click the black bar in the middle of the top of the VM screen.</para>

<section id="allocating_resources-vcpus"><title>CPU<indexterm><primary>&PB; device sharing</primary><secondary>CPU</secondary></indexterm></title>
<para>&PB; provides virtual CPUs (vCPUs) to the VMs running on it. &PB; automatically shares the computing load over the physical CPUs present on the &PB; device.</para>
<para>In general, VMs running more intense workloads (for example, anything multi-threaded or running in separate processes) should be be assigned more vCPUs.</para>
<para>While it is possible to allocate more vCPUs to a VM than the number of physical CPUs on the &PB; hosting them, there is no advantage gained from doing so.</para>

<section id="allocating_resources-memory"><title>RAM<indexterm><primary>&PB; device sharing</primary>

<para>You can allocate available RAM to individual VMs. When a VM is started the specified RAM is hard-allocated to it. On shutting down the VM, the memory is freed and made available for other VMs to use. A certain amount of RAM is required for &PB; operation, so not all installed device RAM is available to be allocated to VMs.</para>

<para><indexterm><primary>&PB;</primary><secondary>networking</secondary></indexterm>&PB; networking is handled on two levels: host-wide connectivity, and the connectivity of each individual VM. A wired or wireless connection is configured using Network Manager in &BC; for the &PB; host. Each VM can then be configured individually to control the level of access to the network or networks that the host is connected to. All network traffic is routed through a single network interface at any given time. By default Network Manager sets up wired networking so that an address will be obtained by DHCP, if possible.</para></section>

<para><indexterm><primary>&PB;</primary><secondary>USB device handling</secondary></indexterm>USB devices are handled differently according to their type. Human Interface Devices (HID) (for example, the mouse and keyboard) are directly connected to the &PB; platform and exposed in a secure manner to the VM that is currently in active use. Other USB devices, for example external disk drives and CD drives, would potentially suffer from contention issues if more than one VM attempts to write to them simultaneously. Because of this, &PB; attaches such devices to the VM that is being used when they are plugged in to the computer. You can also use &BC; to assign a plugged-in USB device to a different VM.</para>

<para>When such a device is plugged in it can be used to control any virtual machine. For examples, keystrokes from a USB keyboard are directed to whichever VM is currently being displayed. A pointing device (for example, a mouse or trackpad) can alternately be assigned to a particular VM if desired, for example, to take advantage of pointing device functionality that is not passed through by &PB;. Doing this might take a short while to take effect if the VM that the device is assigned to does not yet have the required drivers to use the device.

<section id="allocating_resources-manufacturer_specific_features"><title>Manufacturer-Specific Device Features</title>
<para>Supported &PB; devices often come with manufacturer-specific features, such as fingerprint readers, screen brightness control buttons, sound volume control buttons and so on. Some of these devices require software from the manufacturer to be installed in order to get them working correctly. Additionally, most of these features have not been designed for use with multiple VMs running on a device. For example, a sound volume level control button could conceivably increase the volume of all running VMs, or instead just increase the volume of the VM currently in focus, or alternately manipulate the sound volume of all running VMs to be the same as the new value for VM currently in focus. Conversely, when a user manipulates the volume of a VM from within the VM, the question arises whether this should affect the volume of the device as a whole and all the VMs currently running. As this example shows, even simple buttons to increase and decrease volume behave in very complicated fashion when multiple VMs are involved. Many manufacturer-specific devices are simply not designed to function on more than one VM.</para>

<para>&PB; provides the following features and guidance for using manufacturer-specific features:</para>
