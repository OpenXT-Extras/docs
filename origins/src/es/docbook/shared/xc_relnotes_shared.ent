The state of the hardware mute is also toggled when a VM is muted using software, for example when using the Windows taskbar sound icon to mute a VM. Therefore, pressing the hardware mute button when in &BC; and then switching to a VM and muting it using software will cause the VM to be muted and the platform to be unmuted, with the result that there is no sound in the VM.
